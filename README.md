# Cool Algorithms

This is a repository to explore how mathematics and different algorithms can be beautiful and visually appealing.

# How to run an algorithm

Each folder is an algorithm, so first clone the project and move to the folder of the algorithm you would like to run.

Then you can just double click the `index.html` file and see the results in the browser.

Or you can run the following command in the algorithm folder. (Python required)

```
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

or

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

This will open a port at 8000 and you can then go to http://localhost:8000/ and see the results.
